# ABOUT THE PROJECT

SHEE (SURAKSHASAKHI) IS A WEB-BASED WOMEN SAFETY AND EMERGENCY ALERT PLATFORM DESIGNED TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE SUPPORT DURING CRITICAL SITUATIONS.

THIS SYSTEM ALLOWS USERS TO ACTIVATE AN SOS ALERT THAT AUTOMATICALLY CAPTURES THEIR REAL-TIME LOCATION AND SHARES IT WITH TRUSTED CONTACTS.

THE PROJECT COMBINES MODERN WEB DESIGN, RESPONSIVE UI, AND GEOLOCATION TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD A FAST, RELIABLE, AND USER-FRIENDLY SAFETY SOLUTION.
