# ABOUT THE PROJECT

SHEE (SURAKSHASAKHI) IS A WEB-BASED WOMEN SAFETY AND EMERGENCY ALERT PLATFORM DESIGNED TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE SUPPORT DURING CRITICAL SITUATIONS.

THIS SYSTEM ALLOWS USERS TO ACTIVATE AN SOS ALERT THAT AUTOMATICALLY CAPTURES THEIR REAL-TIME LOCATION AND SHARES IT WITH TRUSTED CONTACTS.

THE PROJECT COMBINES MODERN WEB DESIGN, RESPONSIVE UI, AND GEOLOCATION TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD A FAST, RELIABLE, AND USER-FRIENDLY SAFETY SOLUTION.

## SYSTEM WORKFLOW

THE WORKING PROCESS OF THE SYSTEM IS AS FOLLOWS:

1. THE USER ADDS AND STORES TRUSTED EMERGENCY CONTACTS.
2. DURING AN EMERGENCY, THE USER ACTIVATES THE SOS BUTTON.
3. THE SYSTEM ACCESSES THE DEVICE GEOLOCATION USING THE BROWSER GEOLOCATION API.
4. THE CURRENT LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE ARE CAPTURED.
5. A GOOGLE MAPS LINK IS GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY.
6. AN EMERGENCY ALERT MESSAGE IS CREATED.
7. THE ALERT MESSAGE WITH LOCATION DETAILS IS SHARED WITH THE REGISTERED CONTACTS.

THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE SPEED, SIMPLICITY, AND RELIABILITY.
